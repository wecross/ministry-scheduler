## 🤝 How to Contribute when:

### Creating issues:
  - Be sure to pick the right issue type:
    - __Feature request__ : for everything regarding app functionalities 🚀
    - __Support request__ : for questions/suggestions regarding technology/business-logic decisions ❓
    - __Bug report__ : self explanatory 🐞

### (Self-)Assigning issues:
  - Add a comment with the planned start date, respectively when you estimate to be ready
    - Of course, __these dates are approximate__ but they will help us to plan & synchronize our tasks
    - Ex. _"I plan to begin the implementation on monday 16.03 and I expect it to be ready in 1 week"._
  - Please track your working time. This will help us on the long run to better estimate & analyze our efforts
    - see _https://toggl.com/_ (personal plan is free)

### Creating/Reviewing pull requests:
  - Try to have descriptive commit messages & PR titles so that other folks can make sense of what your change is doing
  - When reviewing, link to examples when necessary
